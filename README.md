# Predicting Cricketer's auction price using machine learning models

In this project various machine learning models were developed to predict the cricketer's auction price in IPL. The dataset has 1000 observations and 27 variables that includes statistics of batting performance of a player.
Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis was performed and created visualizations such as heatmap, boxplot and, histogram.
Utilized random forest algorithm to perform feature selection that best determines the cricketer's auction price.
Developed models such as random forest, ridge regression, lasso regression.
Naïve bayes model was used to classify the players into best and moderate batsmen.
To understand the relationship between player's average batting position and auction price in IPL, K-means clustering model was developed.




## Key insights
•	A player's total performance is determined by his or her batting average (Ave) and strike rate (SR). These statistics can be used to assess a player's consistency and ability to score runs rapidly.
•	The number of centuries (100), half-centuries (50), and thirties (30) scored by a player can be used to assess their ability to score huge runs consistently.
•	A player's ability to hit fours and sixes can be assessed using the percentage of runs scored in boundaries (PrB, Pr4, and Pr6).
•	Balls per Boundary (BpB), Balls per 4s (Bp4), and Balls per 6s (Bp6) can provide information on a player's ability to hit boundaries and the frequency with which they hit boundaries.
